## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP10 is a year-long project all about making a website that informs the viewer of the current and future innovations in the topic of my choosing.

For my project, I chose the topic of Economics. 

I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Github. I also chose to independently study Economics in order to help me make by website.

#### Purpose of Freedom Project was to show our abilities and knowledge about bootsrap, HTML, CSS, and A-Frame. Also, purpose was to know if we are eligible to be winners of SEP10 or Honoranble Menions.

## Content

#### Content of Blog was to share my takeaways, skills, challenges, summary, EDP, product and process of my gaols in SEP. It was also about knowing how and why I am grwoing in each blog entry and to be proud of it.
