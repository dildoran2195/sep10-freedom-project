#### In this blog I will be talking about what I learned about A-Frame, how I learned A-Frame, what changes/try/tinkering/and make. I will also provide sources, code snippets, and links to my changes as my evidence of learning.

## What I learned about A-Frame:
* [My changes](https://miniature-spork-5gq6q949q9vj27944-8080.app.github.dev/aframe.html)
* I read [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/)
* It gives me introduction and code for beginners
* "A-Frame is a web framework for building virtual reality (VR) experiences. A-Frame is based on top of HTML, making it simple to get started. But A-Frame is not just a 3D scene graph or a markup language; the core is a powerful entity-component framework that provides a declarative, extensible, and composable structure to three.js."
* I changed height, color, and radius of cylinder into height:4, Color:black, and radius:2.5 but i still want to work on changing shape of cylinder to shape of device
* [I changed shape of cylinder to device which made box and plane to get out from my black grass or floor](https://miniature-spork-5gq6q949q9vj27944-8080.app.github.dev/aframe.html)

* [I went to example of AFRame](https://webvr.soundboxing.co/?challenge=8751ab88-f679-11ea-9f04-8ea7f69e437c)
* I learned that A Frame also can create game not just draft of something
* I was curious about what happens if i will change box to heart and its color to gold on example code of A Frame so I did it and this is [my result](https://miniature-spork-5gq6q949q9vj27944-8080.app.github.dev/aframe.html)
* This was so weird because it didn't work so I didn't see gold or heart but I look forward to learn my tool better in the future
* I felt brave to change position="2 0.25 3" rotation="5 60 0" and color="Purple" so this is my [result](https://miniature-spork-5gq6q949q9vj27944-8080.app.github.dev/aframe.html)

* I Visit this [website](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/faq.html)
* I did Seek for example code
* Use that ex code to make something that applies to your Part B
* Tinker with code
* I will Try new shapes
* Learn how to make 3D model using A-frame

* This [website](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/faq.html) was so cool bc it had code that i can use for free
* for ex: '<a-dodecahedron color="#FF926B" radius="5"></a-dodecahedron>'
* I used this and this is [my changes](https://miniature-spork-5gq6q949q9vj27944-8080.app.github.dev/index.html)
* I read [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/)
* It tells me that  a dodecahedron or dodecahedron is any polyhedron with twelve flat faces.
* [I changed all shapes into new shapes to see how it looks like](https://miniature-spork-5gq6q949q9vj27944-8080.app.github.dev/index.html)
  
* Aframe [website](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/faq.html) have new shapes for me that i didn't know of
* for ex: '<a-cone src="#texture"></a-cone>'
* This code and other shapes made something really cool [my changes](https://miniature-spork-5gq6q949q9vj27944-8080.app.github.dev/index.html)
* I read [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/)
* It tells me that there are diff types of cone but short code for a cone is my fav

## How I learned A-Frame:

#### I used a lot of sources such as websites, etc to learn how to code using A-Frame such as:
* I read [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/) that gives me introduction and code for beginners
* [I went to example of AFRame](https://webvr.soundboxing.co/?challenge=8751ab88-f679-11ea-9f04-8ea7f69e437c) so I learned that A Frame also can create game not just draft of something

## Skills:

#### One skill that I accomplished is How to Learn. Since I was a person who chose A-Frame, it was my job/responsibility to learn how to use A-Frame in order to create whatever I want to create for my SEP10. How I accomplished this skill was by using any source that I was able to such as:
* I read [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/) that gives me introduction and code for beginners
* [I went to example of AFRame](https://webvr.soundboxing.co/?challenge=8751ab88-f679-11ea-9f04-8ea7f69e437c) so I learned that A Frame also can create game not just draft of something

* Aframe [website](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/faq.html) have new shapes for me that i didn't know of
* for ex: '<a-cone src="#texture"></a-cone>'

#### Another skill I accomplished was Consideration. Even though I used a ton of sources to learn my tool. I considered that it wasn't my work so I knew I needed to make something different using whatever I learned from sources about A-Frame. Therefore, my Consideration helped me to create a lot of things such as:
* [My changes](https://miniature-spork-5gq6q949q9vj27944-8080.app.github.dev/aframe.html)
* [I changed shape of cylinder to device which made box and plane to get out from my black grass or floor](https://miniature-spork-5gq6q949q9vj27944-8080.app.github.dev/aframe.html)
