#### In this Blog, I'll be talking about how I makde my MVP, challenges & takeaways while making my MVP.

## How I made my MVP:
#### I made my MVP by having Timeline, writing down what code I need for my MVP, and beyond MVP:

## Timeline
* 4/13/24 finish WireFrame
* 4/14/24 start plan.md
* 4/15/24 start content.md
* 4/16/24 finish context.md
* 4/17/24 start coding, start with <href>bvjhdbrljerhjchbirubcjfr<href><a>

#### MVP

* Hex Color Code
* Heading
* Context
* Part A
* Part B
* Aframe
* CSS
* HTML
* Bootstrap

---

#### Beyond MVP

* Use Wireframe
* Check rubric
* Final changes or edits
* Finish project

#### Also, I made my content so I copied and paste my Part A, Part B, Overview, Possible Solutions, etc which made it so much easier because it saved my time. Therefore, I was confident with my resources. I had my Aframe.md file inside of my SEP10 folder which was really useful because my code for Possible Solutions was already done by myself. I asked XinYang to help me with few of my codes and I also asked for hep from Mr.Mueller because no one is perfect.
