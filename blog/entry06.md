## Content

#### In this Blog, I'll be talking about how I made my MVP, challenges & takeaways, EDP, Sources, Skills whith links and code snippets while making my MVP.

## How I made my MVP:
#### I made my MVP by having Timeline, writing down what code I need for my MVP, and beyond MVP:

### Timeline
* 4/13/24 finish WireFrame
* 4/14/24 start plan.md
* 4/15/24 start content.md
* 4/16/24 finish context.md
* 4/17/24 start coding, start with <href>bvjhdbrljerhjchbirubcjfr<href><a>

### MVP

* Hex Color Code
* Heading
* Context
* Part A
* Part B
* Aframe
* CSS
* HTML
* Bootstrap

---

### Beyond MVP

* Use Wireframe
* Check rubric
* Final changes or edits
* Finish project

#### Also, I made my content so I copied and paste my Part A, Part B, Overview, Possible Solutions, etc which made it so much easier because it saved my time. Therefore, I was confident with my resources. I had my Aframe.md file inside of my SEP10 folder which was really useful because my code for Possible Solutions was already done by myself. I asked XinYang to help me with few of my codes and I also asked for hep from Mr.Mueller because no one is perfect. Check out my [MVP](https://dildoran2195.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/) This is my code for my [MVP](https://github.com/dildoran2195/sep10-freedom-project)


## Challenges & Takeaways:

#### One challenge that I faced was making menu on my website. I did `#context` to make link in order to cerate menu but it didn't work even though I asked for help from one of my peers because she also didn't got it like me. Therefore, I asked help from Mr. Mueller and when he was taking look on my code, I realized that I was missing `#context` in here `<li><a class="dropdown-item" href="#context">Context</a></li>` and I was proud of myself for solving my own issue so far and I fixed that problem. Also, I made link for each section of my website in order to make menu!

#### One takeaway that I faced was not being nervous during asking for help. I needed help so I raised my hand but Mr. Mueller was solving an issue for another student so he sasked that student to help me out and I felt nervous about it. Howerver, that student remid me that my mistale was forgeting this `<h1 id="context" style="text-align: center">Context</h1>` and `<div id="context-id">` so she helped me to solve this issue. Also, I wanted each section of mine to be in center so she taught me this code `<h2> Software: </h2>  <p style="text-align: center">`

#### Another challenges & takeaways that I faced was not checking in with my partner because I was just too cnfident with my [wesbite](https://dildoran2195.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/). Denise saw that my text wasn't big enough but I was able to read what I wrote so I was i don't know but I though other's might not have great eye vision like me so Denise recommended me to add this code to my [wesbite](https://dildoran2195.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/) which was `font-size: 25px;` and  `font-size: 55px;`.


## Sources:
* I read [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/) that gives me introduction and code for beginners
* [I went to example of AFRame](https://webvr.soundboxing.co/?challenge=8751ab88-f679-11ea-9f04-8ea7f69e437c) so I learned that A Frame also can create game not just draft of something

* I Visit this [website](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/faq.html) bc I did Seek for example code and I used that ex code to make something that applies to your Part B. I also Tinker with code
* Learn how to make 3D model using A-frame
* This [website](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/faq.html) was so cool bc it had code that i can use for free
* for ex: `<a-dodecahedron color="#FF926B" radius="5"></a-dodecahedron>`
* Aframe [website](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/faq.html) have new shapes for me that i didn't know of
* for ex: `<a-cone src="#texture"></a-cone>`


## EDP:

#### I did 1, 2, 3 of EDP and my next step was to Create a Prototype which means a first, typical or preliminary model of something, especially a machine, from which other forms are developed or copied. In this case, my prototype was  my [wesbite](https://dildoran2195.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/) that tuned out to be pretty cool even though it was late because I believe it was draft of my SEP10 Project. It still needs an improvement though. WE have like 2 months left and Mr. Mueller said we will work on our final project for this year until school ends so I have enough time to do so.

#### My next step is 5 which is improve Test and evaluate the prototype and I will do this by hearing comments about my project from my peers on Monday because MR. Mueller said we will spend Monday taking a look and making comments about what needs to be improved about your projects. after I get all of my good or bad comments, I'll consider each of it to test and evaluate my prototype. 




## Skills:
#### One skill that I accomplished is How to Learn. Since I was a person who chose A-Frame, it was my job/responsibility to learn how to use A-Frame in order to create whatever I want to create for my SEP10. How I accomplished this skill was by using any source that I was able to such as:
* I read [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/) that gives me introduction and code for beginners
* [I went to example of AFRame](https://webvr.soundboxing.co/?challenge=8751ab88-f679-11ea-9f04-8ea7f69e437c) so I learned that A Frame also can create game not just draft of something

* for ex: `<a-dodecahedron color="#FF926B" radius="5"></a-dodecahedron>`
* Aframe [website](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/faq.html) have new shapes for me that i didn't know of
* for ex: `<a-cone src="#texture"></a-cone>`

#### Another skill I accomplished was Consideration. Even though I used a ton of sources to learn my tool. I considered that it wasn't my work so I knew I needed to make something different using whatever I learned from sources about A-Frame. Therefore, my Consideration helped me to create a lot of things such as:
* [My changes](https://miniature-spork-5gq6q949q9vj27944-8080.app.github.dev/aframe.html)
* [I changed shape of cylinder to device which made box and plane to get out from my black grass or floor](https://miniature-spork-5gq6q949q9vj27944-8080.app.github.dev/aframe.html)
*  I was curious about what happens if i will change box to heart and its color to gold on example code of A Frame so I did it and this is [my result](https://miniature-spork-5gq6q949q9vj27944-8080.app.github.dev/aframe.html)
*   I felt brave to change `position="2 0.25 3" rotation="5 60 0" and color="Purple"` so this is my [result](https://miniature-spork-5gq6q949q9vj27944-8080.app.github.dev/aframe.html)

* I changed height, color, and radius of cylinder into `height:4, Color:black, and radius:2.5` but i still want to work on changing shape of cylinder to shape of device
* [I changed shape of cylinder to device which made box and plane to get out from my black grass or floor](https://miniature-spork-5gq6q949q9vj27944-8080.app.github.dev/aframe.html)
* [I changed all shapes into new shapes to see how it looks like](https://miniature-spork-5gq6q949q9vj27944-8080.app.github.dev/index.html)
