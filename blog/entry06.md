#### In this Blog, I'll be talking about how I makde my MVP, challenges & takeaways while making my MVP.

## How I made my MVP:
#### I made my MVP by having Timeline, writing down what code I need for my MVP, and beyond MVP:

### Timeline
* 4/13/24 finish WireFrame
* 4/14/24 start plan.md
* 4/15/24 start content.md
* 4/16/24 finish context.md
* 4/17/24 start coding, start with <href>bvjhdbrljerhjchbirubcjfr<href><a>

### MVP

* Hex Color Code
* Heading
* Context
* Part A
* Part B
* Aframe
* CSS
* HTML
* Bootstrap

---

### Beyond MVP

* Use Wireframe
* Check rubric
* Final changes or edits
* Finish project

#### Also, I made my content so I copied and paste my Part A, Part B, Overview, Possible Solutions, etc which made it so much easier because it saved my time. Therefore, I was confident with my resources. I had my Aframe.md file inside of my SEP10 folder which was really useful because my code for Possible Solutions was already done by myself. I asked XinYang to help me with few of my codes and I also asked for hep from Mr.Mueller because no one is perfect. Check out my [MVP](https://dildoran2195.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/) This is my code for my [MVP](https://github.com/dildoran2195/sep10-freedom-project)


## Challenges & Takeaways:

#### One challenge that I faced was making menu on my website. I did `#context` to make link in order to cerate menu but it didn't work even though I asked for help from one of my peers because she also didn't got it like me. Therefore, I asked help from Mr. Mueller and when he was taking look on my code, I realized that I was missing `#context` in here `<li><a class="dropdown-item" href="#context">Context</a></li>` and I was proud of myself for solving my own issue so far and I fixed that problem. Also, I made link for each section of my website in order to make menu!

#### One takeaway that I faced was not being nervous during asking for help. I needed help so I raised my hand but Mr. Mueller was solving an issue for another student so he sasked that student to help me out and I felt nervous about it. Howerver, that student remid me that my mistale was forgeting this `<h1 id="context" style="text-align: center">Context</h1>` and `<div id="context-id">` so she helped me to solve this issue. Also, I wanted each section of mine to be in center so she taught me this code `<h2> Software: </h2>  <p style="text-align: center">`

#### Another challenges & takeaways that I faced was not checking in with my partner because I was just too cnfident with my [wesbite](https://dildoran2195.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/). Denise saw that my text wasn't big enough but I was able to read what I wrote so I was i don't know but I though other's might not have great eye vision like me so Denise recommended me to add this code to my [wesbite](https://dildoran2195.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/) which was `font-size: 25px;` and  `font-size: 55px;`.
