# Entry 4
##### 3/5/24

#### In this entry I'll talk about how chose tool for my Freedom Project which was complicated, exciting, and fun. 

## Context

#### I chose Aframe because when I saw what people did with AFrame I loved it and I really wanted to make something that looks like unique device for my Economist App which was from my Part B for my Freedom Project. 

#### I tinkered it with watching video of it called [musical forest](https://aframe.io/showcase/) where a person shares its code and 2 people were touchung to different shapes and colors blocks in musical forest which was pretty cool, wise, and complicated. [In AFrame website](https://aframe.io/examples/), they uploaded example codes of how AFrame looks like so i copied and then paste it (tinkered) on [Replit that showed me land which was green and a bunch of different types and different colors of blocks that were flying on air but I was curious to see different color of sphere position so I changed to blue which looked cool.](https://replit.com/@dildoran2/Tinker#index.html) I also looked at examples of Mr. Mueller that were posted on his slides but it didn't had it's code but it was still cool and complicated for me. My backup ideas are CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid because they're much more easier than AFrame.

## Skills

#### One skill that I accomplished is Consideration. I learned 2 keys from Mr. Mueller which are curiousity and bravery in order to learn by myself and not worry about anything. So I built different type of AFrame example by changing one of its shape to unique color taht did not exist before and this can be used by other people because [my repo](https://replit.com/@dildoran2/Tinker#index.html) is public. Imapct of what we created is great becuase I learned to be curious to see what will happen if I'll do this. Plus, my bravery helped me to have impact of believing in myself. 

#### Another skill that I learned is how to read. I went to [Aframe website](https://aframe.io/) that had article/introduction about it. This article/introduction was not novel so it wasn't easy to know specific thing that it was talking about. For example, "Proven and Scalable: A-Frame has been used by companies such as Google, Disney, Samsung, Toyota, Ford, Chevrolet, Amnesty International, CERN, NPR, Al Jazeera, The Washington Post, NASA. Companies such as Google, Microsoft, Oculus, and Samsung have made contributions to A-Frame." I don't know each of these companies so AFrame supposed to give pictures of how they use it for me to learn more which would be easier for sure but I didn't give up so I made few reaserches about Toyota and Chebrolet which both turned out to be car. Their videos for commercial was pretty cool so I believe they used AFrame for their commercial. 

## Professionalism
#### My learning is improved or conveyed because I gained new skills in each new blog independently even though SEP is too much and stressful. I didn't just gain new skills but also new knowledge of my tool (AFrame) which is something that I never heard of so it was pretty challeneging when it comes to how I tinkered with it but I still win over it because Mr. Mueller gived me an example which is "What happens if I change its color, radius, size" and this was helpul.
