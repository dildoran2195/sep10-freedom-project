# Entry 4
##### 3/5/24

#### In this entry I'll talk about how chose tool for my Freedom Project which was complicated, exciting, and fun. 

## Context
#### I chose Aframe because when I saw what people did with AFrame I loved it and I really wanted to make something that looks like unique device for my Economist App which was from my Part B for my Freedom Project. 

#### I tinkered it with watching video of it called [musical forest](https://aframe.io/showcase/) where a person shares its code and 2 people were touchung to different shapes and colors blocks in musical forest which was pretty cool, wise, and complicated. [In AFrame website](https://aframe.io/examples/), they uploaded example codes of how AFrame looks like so i copied and then paste it (tinkered) on [Replit that showed me land which was green and a bunch of different types and different colors of blocks that were flying on air but I was curious to see different color of sphere position so I changed to blue which looked cool.](https://replit.com/@dildoran2/Tinker#index.html) I also looked at examples of Mr. Mueller that were posted on his slides but it didn't had it's code but it was still cool and complicated for me. My backup ideas are CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid because they're much more easier than AFrame.
