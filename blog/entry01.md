## My Entry: Economics

  Why Economics
</h1>
For my project, I chose the topic of Economics after thinking if I will choose jewerly/goods or education but I didn´t because I love to improve more on economics. I want to choose this topic as my major at Brooklyn College. This topic covers existed and significant things such as tax, business, interest rates, wealth, and inflation. I´m obsessed with business that have companies making cool cars in modern days by Economics, especailly Tesla because this comapny have a lot of benefits such as smaller carbon footprint, increased performance, advanced technology, and social status. I liked to see great examples of Tesla that gived me cool and different ideas at some point for my website about cars. Lastly, my backup ideas are luxury Goods/Jewelry and Economic.
Look at the example for Blog 1 Entry 1:
The two main links that I used to explore was 10 Signs That You Should Become an Architect and How Technology Is Transforming Architectural Design. The first link helps me know what the field architecture is. And the second link tells me what technologies are used in the field of Architecture. Some other links that I had explored were What Tools Does an Architect Use? and 25 Tools and Devices for Architects — Journey of an Architect. These two were links that helped me understand the intro of architecturing and what were devices/technology that were helpful in architecture.

EDP
Now, I am on the (Step 1) defining and the (Step 2) researching step of the EDP (engineering design process). At first, we were defining what we are most passionate about. Then, we do more deep research in the field that we are more passionate about and do more research about the technology that is used in that career. For instance, some technologies that were used in the field of architecture are “3D printers, augmented writing, and virtual reality.” I think I'll be on step 2 for a while before I move on to the next step of brainstorming possible solutions.

Skills
One skill that I learned during this experience is How to Google. I say this because in this part of the project, we were able to use Google and do different research for different technologies in different fields of careers. When I looked up "architecture innovations," I found a lot of cool stuff, but it wasn't necessarily technology. A lot of it was design-related, such as repurposing shipping containers for things like gardens or homes. So I had to add the word "technology" to my search and that really helped me confirm that I'm interested in existing and also future technology of architecture.

Another skill that I also achieved was How to Read. After googling, we needed to see which article matches with the topic by reading closely. There were a lot of terms I didn't know, such as "CAD" (which I then Googled, and that ties into my first skill. By the way, it means "computer aided design"). But reading an article is a lot different than reading a novel. A lot of articles have headings and subheadings that break up the text into smaller chunks, making it easier to read. I think that also helps me in the way that I write, for example, I added headings to this blog entry so that hopefully it's easier for you to read!

Summary
Overall, I'm really excited to make a website about the technology of architecture. It all started with the inspiration of a restaurant in Fort Hamilton, and maybe I'll have a future career in architecture!

I wanted to solve main issues in 2023 on economins so I chose [Global Outlook, June 2023](https://www.oecd.org/economic-outlook/june-2023/). This article
