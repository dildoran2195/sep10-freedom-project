  Why Economics
</h1>
<h4>For my project, I chose the topic of Economics after thinking if I should choose jewerly/goods or education but I didn´t because I love to improve more on economics. I want to choose this topic as my major at Brooklyn College. This topic covers existed and significant things such as tax, business, interest rates, wealth, and inflation. I'm obsessed with business that have websites for companies making cool cars in modern days by Economics, especailly Tesla because this comapny have a lot of benefits such as smaller carbon footprint, increased performance, advanced technology, and social status. I liked to see great examples of Tesla that gived me positive ideas at some point for my website about cars. Lastly, my backup ideas are luxury Goods/Jewelry and Education.</h4>

<h4>I used [3 Ways to Help Improve Economy](https://www.wikihow.com/Help-Improve-the-Economy), [What Are Ways Economic Growth Can Be Archived](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/032415/what-are-some-ways-economic-growth-can-be-achieved.asp), and [10 Things To Know About Economic Development](https://www.ci.saginaw.tx.us/DocumentCenter/View/12175/BSC_10_things_to_know_about_econ_devt_) as the three main links. The first link helps me how business is going to start successfully by economics. While the 2nd link tells me about key takeaways of economics. My last link taught me what are different types of ways to improve anything such as education, health, and literacy by economics. All of my great links that helped me learn deep and the development of economics were clear, specific and beneficial.</h4>

  Engineering Design Process
</h1>
<h4> Now, I'm on the defining the problem which is Step 1 and the research the problem which is Step 2 of the EDP (Engineering design process). At first, I defined that I'm most passionate about Economics especially business. Therefore, I google "What are  problem of technology in economics?" and problem I found includes, "the positive impacts of new technologies must be balanced against their negative impacts or costs". For Step 1, I think problem in economics is that we need to know if new technology has the most benefits or the harms by comparing their benefits with harms. For Step 2, I found out that "America’s political economy is better equipped to monetize the benefits of new technologies than regulate and mitigate the costs they bring". Therefore, I'll find great solution for Step 3 which is Brainstorm Possible Solutions.</h4>

<h1>
  Skills
</h1>
One skill that I learned during this experience is How to Google. I say this because in this part of the project, we were able to use Google and do different research for different technologies in different fields of careers. When I looked up "architecture innovations," I found a lot of cool stuff, but it wasn't necessarily technology. A lot of it was design-related, such as repurposing shipping containers for things like gardens or homes. So I had to add the word "technology" to my search and that really helped me confirm that I'm interested in existing and also future technology of architecture.

Another skill that I also achieved was How to Read. After googling, we needed to see which article matches with the topic by reading closely. There were a lot of terms I didn't know, such as "CAD" (which I then Googled, and that ties into my first skill. By the way, it means "computer aided design"). But reading an article is a lot different than reading a novel. A lot of articles have headings and subheadings that break up the text into smaller chunks, making it easier to read. I think that also helps me in the way that I write, for example, I added headings to this blog entry so that hopefully it's easier for you to read!

  Summary

<h4> Overall, I'm really excited to make a website about the technology of architecture. It all started with the inspiration of a restaurant in Fort Hamilton, and maybe I'll have a future career in architecture!
