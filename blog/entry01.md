## My Entry: Economics
#### 10/26/23

### Why Economics

#### For my project, I chose the topic of Economics after thinking if I should choose jewelry/goods or education but I didn't because I love to improve more on economics. I want to choose this topic as my major at Brooklyn College. This topic covers existing and significant things such as tax, business, interest rates, wealth, and inflation. I'm obsessed with businesses that have websites for companies making cool cars in modern days by Economics, especially Tesla because this company has a lot of benefits such as smaller carbon footprint, increased performance, advanced technology, and social status. I liked to see great examples of Tesla that gave me positive ideas at some point for my website about cars. Lastly, my backup ideas are luxury Goods/Jewelry and Education.

#### I used [3 Ways to Help Improve Economy](https://www.wikihow.com/Help-Improve-the-Economy), [What Are Ways Economic Growth Can Be Archived](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/032415/what-are-some-ways-economic-growth-can-be-achieved.asp), and [10 Things To Know About Economic Development](https://www.ci.saginaw.tx.us/DocumentCenter/View/12175/BSC_10_things_to_know_about_econ_devt_) as the three main links. The first link helps me understand how business is going to start successfully in economics. While the 2nd link tells me about key takeaways of economics. My last link taught me what are different types of ways to improve anything such as education, health, and literacy by economics. All of my great links that helped me learn deep and the development of economics were clear, specific and beneficial.

### Engineering Design Process


#### Now, I'm defining the problem which is Step 1 and researching the problem which is Step 2 of the EDP (Engineering design process). At first, I defined that I'm most passionate about Economics, especially business. Therefore, I googled "What are the problems of technology in economics?" A problem I found includes, "the positive impacts of new technologies must be balanced against their negative impacts or costs". For Step 1, I think the problem in economics is that we need to know if new technology has the most benefits or the harms by comparing their benefits with harms. For Step 2, I found out that "Americaâ€™s political economy is better equipped to monetize the benefits of new technologies than to regulate and mitigate the costs they bring". Therefore, I'll find great solution for Step 3 which is Brainstorm Possible Solutions.


### Skills


#### Attention to detail is one of the two skills that I learned during this part of the project. I was able to read whatever I wrote for this part and fix any spelling, missing, grammar errors therefore I say this. I did not spell the following words accurately, economics, engineering, and technology and I realize that something is wrong with these words so I spell them differently where I did not realize anything is wrong with it. I was missing heading for EDP and one of my friends helped me find this so I wrote heading for EDP. I had grammar errors with not using a period after each of my sentences and question mark after few of my sentences but I didn't think if I wrote any questions so I only fixed a period part independently!

#### Debugging is the 2nd skill that is accomplished. I went to slides for this part of the project from SEP10 and I read that I need bold/underline/lists/multipleParagraphs,etc and I wanted to make it bold. Unfortunately, I forgot how to make it bold. Therefore, I went to my notes for SEP10 and I found opening and closing tags of h1 which usually are going to be used if anyone wants bold/big words as heading but I didn't need big words so I chose opening and closing tags of h4 which did turn out to be used for bold and medium size of words. 


### Summary


#### Finally, I'm really nervous about making a website about the technology of economics. It started with the inspiration of being popular, rich, and great business lady and I believe myself that I will become great, rich, and popular business lady in the future after graduating from NYU and choosing economics as my major.
