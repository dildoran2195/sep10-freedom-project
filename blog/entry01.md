## My Entry: Economics

  Why Economics
</h1>
For my project, I chose the topic of Economics after thinking if I will choose jewerly/goods or education but I didn´t because I love to improve more on economics. I want to choose this topic as my major at Brooklyn College. This topic covers existed and significant things such as tax, business, interest rates, wealth, and inflation. I´m obsessed with business that have websites for companies making cool cars in modern days by Economics, especailly Tesla because this comapny have a lot of benefits such as smaller carbon footprint, increased performance, advanced technology, and social status. I liked to see great examples of Tesla that gived me positive ideas at some point for my website about cars. Lastly, my backup ideas are luxury Goods/Jewelry and Education. 

I used [3 Ways to Help Improve Economy](https://www.wikihow.com/Help-Improve-the-Economy), [What Are Ways Economic Growth Can Be Archived](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/032415/what-are-some-ways-economic-growth-can-be-achieved.asp), and [10 Things To Know About Economic Development](https://www.ci.saginaw.tx.us/DocumentCenter/View/12175/BSC_10_things_to_know_about_econ_devt_) as the two main links. The first links helps me how businss is going to start successfully by economics. While the 2nd link tells me about key takeaways of economics. My last link taught me what are different types of ways to improve anything such as education, health, and literacy by economics. All of my great links that helped me learn deep and the development of economics were clear, specific and beneficial.

  EDP
</h1>
Dont use anything from example below for edp summary and skills because it is cheating and you are in list of cheaters so this time it is either parent meeting or phone call and 50 on any of your school work so do it on your own. this work needs to have multiple paragrps that are separated so google about this or ask slack
EDP
Now, I am on the (Step 1) defining and the (Step 2) researching step of the EDP (engineering design process). At first, we were defining what we are most passionate about. Then, we do more deep research in the field that we are more passionate about and do more research about the technology that is used in that career. For instance, some technologies that were used in the field of architecture are “3D printers, augmented writing, and virtual reality.” I think I'll be on step 2 for a while before I move on to the next step of brainstorming possible solutions.

Skills
One skill that I learned during this experience is How to Google. I say this because in this part of the project, we were able to use Google and do different research for different technologies in different fields of careers. When I looked up "architecture innovations," I found a lot of cool stuff, but it wasn't necessarily technology. A lot of it was design-related, such as repurposing shipping containers for things like gardens or homes. So I had to add the word "technology" to my search and that really helped me confirm that I'm interested in existing and also future technology of architecture.

Another skill that I also achieved was How to Read. After googling, we needed to see which article matches with the topic by reading closely. There were a lot of terms I didn't know, such as "CAD" (which I then Googled, and that ties into my first skill. By the way, it means "computer aided design"). But reading an article is a lot different than reading a novel. A lot of articles have headings and subheadings that break up the text into smaller chunks, making it easier to read. I think that also helps me in the way that I write, for example, I added headings to this blog entry so that hopefully it's easier for you to read!

Summary
Overall, I'm really excited to make a website about the technology of architecture. It all started with the inspiration of a restaurant in Fort Hamilton, and maybe I'll have a future career in architecture!
