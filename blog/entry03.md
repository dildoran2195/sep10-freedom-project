## EDP
#### I completed Step 4 which was Create a prototype. Prototype is my creation which is the project I'm doing. I did my own thinking and building in my head in order to do my Part A. Even though Part A was mostly about doing research but I also read and think if what I read about websites that I found is enough and accurate for economists in order to improve on economics. This also required my building skill in my head because websites that I found gived me introduction about it so I tried to find if those websites are build enough and they were build enough. Yay!

#### I also completed Step 5 which was test and evaluate the prototype. This step was mostly required to complete my Part B which was doing future plans about websites and gadgets for economists in order to improve economics. I test whatever I found in my with finding companies that does most of the work for my website and gadgets. I also evaluated my Part B with believing that my websites and gadgets are enough for future bevause I determined it's benefits to economists in order to improve on economics. My future steps should be improving as needed (Step 7) & Communicate the results (Step 8). 

## Skills
#### One skill that I accomplished is Creativity. I gain this skill from doing my Part B which was plans for future for economists in order to improve on economics. In this part, I used my creativity to find enough websites and gadgets on my own that does not exist yet which was pretty cool.

#### 2nd skill that I accomplished is Embracing failure. When I completed both of my Part A and Part B, Mr. Mueller told as to share with others in 2026 on slack so I did and got great and a bit of dissapointed comments but that dissapointed comments helped to learn from my mistakes. That dissapointed told me that I need to write how my websites gets its information and money, and I also needed some gadgets. Therefore, I found companies that could support my wesbites because their benefits and purpose was similar to purpose and benefits of my websites. For my gadgets I did the same which was great.

## Summary
#### Finally, I'm excited for my EDP because I only have 2 more steps left to complete because I already got experiences doing Steps 1 through 6. Plus, I'm proud of myself that I did Blog 3.
