In this blog, IÂ´ll talk about, The minimum viable products were filled by me and I was able to make components in my project functional. This includes my navbar, which scrolls to a designated section of my project, my A-frame model, in which the camera is movable and my model is complete, and my images, which are present on my website. My content was also sufficient in providing adequate context to my research topic on medicine, I Incorporated my LOYO tool (Aframe). My website was also practical and original. Including the minimum requirements for my project was able to earn me a product score which I was satisfied with.
