In this blog, IÂ´ll talk about,how I presented my MVP in class presentataion and at expo, challenges & takeaways, EDP, Sources, Skills with links and code snippets while presenting my MVP. The minimum viable products were filled by me and my project was functional b/c I made components for it which is my navbar. Navbar is going to scroll to a designated section of both my project & A-frame model. Therefore, the camera in both of my project & model is movable and my model is complete even though I need more images so present on my website. In order to provide adequate context to my research topic on economics, I used Google & LOYO tool (Aframe). Practical and original can be described by my wesbite. Also,The minimum requirements helped me to get 10/10 for my product. Asking many questions from my peers and teachers was key to complete my entire project. I was not sufficemt in terms of visuals and presence even though I handled the hood, coherence, and conclusion.
