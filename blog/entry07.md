# Entry 7
##### 6/9/24

### Content:

#### In this blog, I´ll talk about how I presented my MVP in class presentation and at expo, challenges & takeaways, EDP, Sources, Skills with links and code snippets while presenting my MVP. The minimum viable products were filled by me and my project was functional b/c I made components for it which is my navbar. Navbar is going to scroll to a designated section of both my project & A-frame model. Therefore, the camera in both of my project & model is movable and my model is complete even though I need more images so present on my website. In order to provide adequate context to my research topic on economics, I used Google & LOYO tool (Aframe). Practical and original can be described by my website. Also,The minimum requirements helped me to get 10/10 for my product. Asking many questions from my peers and teachers was key to completing my entire project. I was not sufficient in terms of visuals and presence even though I handled the hood, coherence, and conclusion.

### Skills

#### Skills that I gained were self-learning: learning something independently is hard so use much sources as you need  and ask for help from your friends, teacher, etc. I also gained time management:I learned dealing with my time effectively. Organization is my new skill too:I learned to better categorize and Different components of my project and in my life. Therefore, my presentation both in class and at the expo was beneficial b/c it was a learning and comfort zone for me.

#### One skill that I accomplished during my presentation in class and at the expo was How to Learn b/c I heard, saw, and learned how my peers were presenting their project to us and judges. Another skill I accomplished was Consideration b/c I considered rubric and examples of how to present my project in both class presentation and at the expo. Therefore, better independence was gained in both class presentation and at the expo. Also, I was not being too overwhelmed and giving myself a break because I respect myself.

## Challenges & Takeaways:

#### One challenge that I faced was making eye contact beside the teacher in my class presentation. Also, everything was going well but I was supposed to not read off the screen during my class presentation. Therefore, 2 points were taken away from my score. However, I did my best to complete my project. for ex, I did `#context` to make a link in order to create a menu but it didn't work even though I asked for help from one of my peers because she also didn't get it like me. Therefore, I asked help from Mr. Mueller and when he was taking look on my code, I realized that I was missing `#context` in here `<li><a class="dropdown-item" href="#context">Context</a></li>` and I was proud of myself for solving my own issue so far and I fixed that problem. Also, I made links for each section of my website in order to make a menu!

#### One takeaway that I faced during presenting my project at expo was not talking openly b/c I was just nervous when judges came to me. Also, I did not know what the responsiveness of my project was so I think I got 2 or 1. However, I did my best to complete my project. For ex, I was not nervous when asking for help. I needed help so I raised my hand but Mr. Mueller was solving an issue for another student so he asked that student to help me out and I felt nervous about it. However, that student reminded me that my mistake was forgetting this `<h1 id="context" style="text-align: center">Context</h1>` and `<div id="context-id">` so she helped me to solve this issue. Also, I wanted each section of mine to be in center so she taught me this code `<h2> Software: </h2>  <p style="text-align: center">`

#### Another challenge & takeaways that I faced was not checking rubric for both of my expo presentation and in class presentation. Also, I did not do my slides for the in class presentation on time. However, I did my best to complete my project. For example, I was supposed to check in with my partner because I was just too confident with my [wesbite](https://dildoran2195.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/). Denise saw that my text wasn't big enough but I was able to read what I wrote so I was i don't know but I thought others might not have great eye vision like me so Denise recommended me to add this code to my [wesbite](https://dildoran2195.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/) which was `font-size: 25px;` and  `font-size: 55px;`.

* I read [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/) that gives me introduction and code for beginners
* [I went to example of AFRame](https://webvr.soundboxing.co/?challenge=8751ab88-f679-11ea-9f04-8ea7f69e437c) so I learned that A Frame also can create game not just draft of something

* I Visit this [website](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/faq.html) bc I did Seek for example code and I used that ex code to make something that applies to your Part B. I also Tinker with code
* Learn how to make 3D model using A-frame
* This [website](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/faq.html) was so cool bc it had code that i can use for free
* for ex: `<a-dodecahedron color="#FF926B" radius="5"></a-dodecahedron>`
* Aframe [website](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/faq.html) have new shapes for me that i didn't know of
* for ex: `<a-cone src="#texture"></a-cone>`


## EDP:

#### Since I finished 1, 2, 3 of EDP, my next step was to Create a Prototype which means a first, typical or preliminary model of something, especially a machine, from which other forms are developed or copied. In this case, my prototype was  my [wesbite](https://dildoran2195.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/) that turned out to be pretty cool even though it was late because I believe it was draft of my SEP10 Project. An improvement for my project was completed so my presentation in class and at the expo was far enough. I had enough time to do any step of my EDP and my final project took my whole entire year to learn and complete only to present in class and at the expo which was exciting and not easy for most of the time. 

#### My next step was to improve the Test and evaluate the prototype and I did this by considering each of them to test and evaluate my prototype and do my best in both class presentations and at expo presentations. Also, The last few stages of the engineering design process was done by me which was to improve as needed alongside communicating the results. A gallery walk in class and receiving growth and glows from my peers were keys to improve my poject. In order to acknowledge and work on issues about my project which I was sometimes completely unaware of, I considered feedback about my project.Therefore, my presentation in both class presentation and at the expo was gained by communicating my results.

### Summary/Reflection

#### Even though I faced a lot of challenges, I gained more skills and takeaways. Therefore, it is my goal to work on future projects to do better in SEP11, where I can brainstorm more ideas relating to economics or another topic that I´m passionate about.
