### Content:

#### In this blog, IÂ´ll talk about,how I presented my MVP in class presentataion and at expo, challenges & takeaways, EDP, Sources, Skills with links and code snippets while presenting my MVP. The minimum viable products were filled by me and my project was functional b/c I made components for it which is my navbar. Navbar is going to scroll to a designated section of both my project & A-frame model. Therefore, the camera in both of my project & model is movable and my model is complete even though I need more images so present on my website. In order to provide adequate context to my research topic on economics, I used Google & LOYO tool (Aframe). Practical and original can be described by my wesbite. Also,The minimum requirements helped me to get 10/10 for my product. Asking many questions from my peers and teachers was key to complete my entire project. I was not sufficemt in terms of visuals and presence even though I handled the hood, coherence, and conclusion. 

## Challenges & Takeaways:

#### One challenge that I faced was making an eye contact beside the teacher in my class presentation. I did `#context` to make link in order to cerate menu but it didn't work even though I asked for help from one of my peers because she also didn't got it like me. Therefore, I asked help from Mr. Mueller and when he was taking look on my code, I realized that I was missing `#context` in here `<li><a class="dropdown-item" href="#context">Context</a></li>` and I was proud of myself for solving my own issue so far and I fixed that problem. Also, I made link for each section of my website in order to make menu!

#### One takeaway that I faced was not being nervous during asking for help. I needed help so I raised my hand but Mr. Mueller was solving an issue for another student so he sasked that student to help me out and I felt nervous about it. Howerver, that student remid me that my mistale was forgeting this `<h1 id="context" style="text-align: center">Context</h1>` and `<div id="context-id">` so she helped me to solve this issue. Also, I wanted each section of mine to be in center so she taught me this code `<h2> Software: </h2>  <p style="text-align: center">`

#### Another challenges & takeaways that I faced was not checking in with my partner because I was just too cnfident with my [wesbite](https://dildoran2195.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/). Denise saw that my text wasn't big enough but I was able to read what I wrote so I was i don't know but I though other's might not have great eye vision like me so Denise recommended me to add this code to my [wesbite](https://dildoran2195.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/) which was `font-size: 25px;` and  `font-size: 55px;`.


## Sources:
* I read [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/) that gives me introduction and code for beginners
* [I went to example of AFRame](https://webvr.soundboxing.co/?challenge=8751ab88-f679-11ea-9f04-8ea7f69e437c) so I learned that A Frame also can create game not just draft of something

* I Visit this [website](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/faq.html) bc I did Seek for example code and I used that ex code to make something that applies to your Part B. I also Tinker with code
* Learn how to make 3D model using A-frame
* This [website](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/faq.html) was so cool bc it had code that i can use for free
* for ex: `<a-dodecahedron color="#FF926B" radius="5"></a-dodecahedron>`
* Aframe [website](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/faq.html) have new shapes for me that i didn't know of
* for ex: `<a-cone src="#texture"></a-cone>`


## EDP:

#### I did 1, 2, 3 of EDP and my next step was to Create a Prototype which means a first, typical or preliminary model of something, especially a machine, from which other forms are developed or copied. In this case, my prototype was  my [wesbite](https://dildoran2195.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/) that tuned out to be pretty cool even though it was late because I believe it was draft of my SEP10 Project. It still needs an improvement though. WE have like 2 months left and Mr. Mueller said we will work on our final project for this year until school ends so I have enough time to do so.

#### My next step is 5 which is improve Test and evaluate the prototype and I will do this by hearing comments about my project from my peers on Monday because MR. Mueller said we will spend Monday taking a look and making comments about what needs to be improved about your projects. after I get all of my good or bad comments, I'll consider each of it to test and evaluate my prototype.
