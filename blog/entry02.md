#### I completed my FP synthesize Part A that has information about `software` and `hardware` for economists. `Software` is a collection of websites, data, and progarms that tell a computer how to perform specific tasks while hardware is gadgets, tools, and machinery. My 1st google search for FP synthesize Part A (`Software`): “Economics `software`” and 1st website I looked into: [Gretl](https://gretl.sourceforge.net/). 

### Benefits of [Gretl](https://gretl.sourceforge.net/)
* Used by mainly econometrics and public
* This website is an open-source statistical package, mainly for econometrics.
* This website have translated version into French, Turkish, Japanese, etc of themselves for people who don't speak in English. It is free, open-source software, and time-series library.
* Integrated powerful scripting language (known as hansl), with a wide range of programming tools and matrix operations. Clear, specific, and doesn't take a long time. 

### 2nd website for `software`: [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)
* Used my students, public, and econometrics. 
* It have get support
* MATLAB can be used with a lot, academic, different, and significant stuff.
* One of the Capabilities of this website is all building.

### Last or 3rd website for `software`: [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/XBZ7DOJM) 
* This website have pricing plans
* Similar products
* Popular features
* Resources
* Pricing plans.

### My FP synthesize Part A (`Hardware`): [Apple M2 chip](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTaIyectOULM1gbVwQHqXN7Q5QzveLXssz5lSkL7nQVA&s)
* It is used by economists
* It also have the M2 chip is powerful enough for demanding data analysis
* Presentations
* Organization
* Statistics
* Strategy
* Finance
* Studies
* Write strategy
* Marketing plans
* Read and write articles
* Prepare presentations
* Make analyses.
* To write a marketing or sales plan, you do quantitative and qualitative research.

### 2nd `hardware` that I found is [Lenovo ThinkPad E15 Gen 2 Home & Business Laptop](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71hwpV5oXsL._AC_UF894,1000_QL80_.jpg)
* It is used by economists and businessmen or businesswomen
* [Powerful Performance with AMD Ryzen 5 4500U Hexa Core】 4th Gen AMD Ryzen 5 4500U 2.3GHz Processor (upto 4 GHz, 8MB Cache, 6-Cores) ; AMD Radeon Integrated Graphics
* [High Speed and Multitasking] 16GB DDR4 RAM (8GB Onboard + 8GB SODIMM); 65W Power Supply, 3-Cell 45 WHr Battery; Silver Color

* 1 Year Manufacturer warranty from GreatPriceTech (Professionally upgraded by GreatPriceTech) Includes Dockstar USB Hub(Special Edition Portable Docztorm Data Hub;Super Speedy Data Syn Rate upto 5Gbps)

### 3rd `hardware` I found is [Acer Chromebook Spin 314 Convertible Laptop](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51soQu6K+FL.jpg) 
* It is sed by public and economists
* Chromebook runs on Chrome OS - An operating system by Google that is built for the way we live today
* It updates automatically, boots up in seconds and continues to stay fast over time
* You can edit, download, and convert Microsoft Office files in Google Docs, Sheets and Slides.

## Engineering Design Process

#### Since I completed Define the problem which was Step 1 and I also completed Research the problem which was Step 2. I'm on Brainstorm possible solutions which is Step 3. Therefore, I did a lot of research's about `hardware` and `software` for economists that should sovle issues that poor economists are facing today. It was not easy but interesting because I gained a lot of knowledge about what I'm passionate. Even though, it was frustrating because not all websites are accurate and appropriate. Therefore, I read a lot of websites about `hardware` and `software` but best programs, websites, and data for `software` were [Gretl](https://gretl.sourceforge.net/), [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html), and [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/XBZ7DOJM) while best gadgets, tools, and machinery were [Apple M2 chip](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTaIyectOULM1gbVwQHqXN7Q5QzveLXssz5lSkL7nQVA&s), [Lenovo ThinkPad E15 Gen 2 Home & Business Laptop](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71hwpV5oXsL._AC_UF894,1000_QL80_.jpg), and [Acer Chromebook Spin 314 Convertible Laptop](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51soQu6K+FL.jpg). I also completed Plan the most promising solution which is Step 4 and I found possible solutions by `hardware and `software` for issues that economists are facing and that solutions will work. My plans for next step which is Create a prototype inclues, I'm am nervous about this step because I don't have experience doing Step 5 and I have no idea what work prototype means but I should be great because I survived when completing Step 1, Step 2, and Step 3, Step 4.

## Skills

#### One skill that I gained is Organization by FP synthesize Part A that has information about `software` and `hardware` for economists becasuse I need to find detials about any gadget, tools, machinery for `hardware` and programs, websites, and data for `software` so I did find a lot. Therefore, I needed to organize details that I found in order to not get confused and frustrated while I'm using that details for something else. Plus, I'll feel unconfident when I don't organize my details for Freedom Project that will have impact on my future while I'm doing my SEP homework or classwork.

#### Another skill that I gained is Collaboration by FP synthesize Part A that has information about `software` and `hardware` for economists because I ask a lot of help from Mr. Mueller and a junior whos name is Samuel. One day, Mr.Mueller introduced a junior named Samuel to us because I think he was great in SEP so he probably got Mr.Mueller's trust and attention. Therefore, he was in school to help us especially me when I was finding my `hardware`. It wasn't easy to find gadget by doing reaserch in Google so I call on that wise junior and he told me AI was not gadget which was big help because if he didn't told that to me, I'll be keep thinking `software` is `hardware` when it was not accurate. I also raise my hand to Mr.Mueller to help me if I need to paste link to logo of data or program that I found and I did needed that link so I did paste it but later I also paste link to website becasuse I though it was really beneficial. Therefore, thank you to both of hese people whom are Mr.Mueller and Samuel. 

## Summary
I'm really proud that I completed my FP synthesize Part A that has information about `software` and `hardware` for economists because it helped me to gain skills for my future. This was not easy bceuase it was challenging and I never had experience doing FP synthesize Part A therefore I'm hapy that I got through this complicated progress.
