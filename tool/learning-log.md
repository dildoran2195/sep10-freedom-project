Tool: **AFrame**

---

3/3/24:
* [My changes](https://miniature-spork-5gq6q949q9vj27944-8080.app.github.dev/aframe.html)
* I read [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/)
* It gived me intrdocution and code for beginners
* "A-Frame is a web framework for building virtual reality (VR) experiences. A-Frame is based on top of HTML, making it simple to get started. But A-Frame is not just a 3D scene graph or a markup language; the core is a powerful entity-component framework that provides a declarative, extensible, and composable structure to three.js."
* I changed height, color, and radius of sylinder into height:4, Color:black, and radius:2.5 but i still want to work on changing shape of cylinder to shape of device
* [I changed shape of cylinder to device which made box and plane to get out from my black grass or floor](https://miniature-spork-5gq6q949q9vj27944-8080.app.github.dev/aframe.html)
* My next steps:
Watch tutorial
Make something similar to flower bc its cute

3/11/24:
* [I went to example of AFRame](https://webvr.soundboxing.co/?challenge=8751ab88-f679-11ea-9f04-8ea7f69e437c)
* I learned that Aframealso can create game not just draft of something
* I was curious about what heppens if i will change box to heart and its color to gold on example code of Aframe so I did it and this is [my result](https://miniature-spork-5gq6q949q9vj27944-8080.app.github.dev/aframe.html)
* This was so weird because it didn't work so I didn't see gold or heart but I look forward to learn my tool better in the future
* I felt brave to change position="2 0.25 3" rotation="5 60 0" and color="Purple" so this is my [result](https://miniature-spork-5gq6q949q9vj27944-8080.app.github.dev/aframe.html)
* My next steps
Try different shapes on Aframe
Try unique colors on Aframe

4/3/24:
* I Visit this [website](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/faq.html)
* I did Seek for example code
* Use that ex code to make something that applies to your Part B
* Tinker with code
* I will Try new shapes
* Learn how to make 3D model using A-frame

make something similar to

4/4/24:
* This [website](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/faq.html) was so cool bc it had code that ican use for free
* for ex: "<a-dodecahedron color="#FF926B" radius="5"></a-dodecahedron>"
* I used this and this is [my changes](https://miniature-spork-5gq6q949q9vj27944-8080.app.github.dev/index.html)
* I read [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/)
* It tells what my code was  a dodecahedron or duodecahedron is any polyhedron with twelve flat faces.
* [I changed all sahpes into new shapes to see hw it looks like](https://miniature-spork-5gq6q949q9vj27944-8080.app.github.dev/index.html)
* My next steps:
try adding text

4/5/24:
* Aframe [website](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/faq.html) have new shapes for me that i didnt know of
* for ex: "<a-cone src="#texture"></a-cone>"
* This code and other shapes made something really cool [my changes](https://miniature-spork-5gq6q949q9vj27944-8080.app.github.dev/index.html)
* I read [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/)
* It tells me that there are diff types of cone but short code for a cone is my fav
* [I changed all sahpes into new shapes to see hw it looks like](https://miniature-spork-5gq6q949q9vj27944-8080.app.github.dev/index.html)
* My next steps:
new unique shapes
try adding text
