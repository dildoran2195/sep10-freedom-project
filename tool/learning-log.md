3/3/24:
* [My changes](https://miniature-spork-5gq6q949q9vj27944-8080.app.github.dev/aframe.html)
* I read [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/)
* It gived me intrdocution and code for beginners
* "A-Frame is a web framework for building virtual reality (VR) experiences. A-Frame is based on top of HTML, making it simple to get started. But A-Frame is not just a 3D scene graph or a markup language; the core is a powerful entity-component framework that provides a declarative, extensible, and composable structure to three.js."
* I changed height, color, and radius of sylinder into height:4, Color:black, and radius:2.5 but i still want to work on changing shape of cylinder to shape of device
* [I changed shape of cylinder to device which made box and plane to get out from my black grass or floor](https://miniature-spork-5gq6q949q9vj27944-8080.app.github.dev/aframe.html)
* My next steps:

* [I went to example of AFRame](https://webvr.soundboxing.co/?challenge=8751ab88-f679-11ea-9f04-8ea7f69e437c)
* I learned that Aframealso can create game not just draft of something
* I was curious about what heppens if i will change box to heart and its color to gold on example code of Aframe so I did it and this is [my result](https://miniature-spork-5gq6q949q9vj27944-8080.app.github.dev/aframe.html)
* This was so weird because it didn't work so I didn't see gold or heart but I look forward to learn my tool better in the future
* I felt brave to change position="2 0.25 3" rotation="5 60 0" and color="Purple" so this is my [result](https://miniature-spork-5gq6q949q9vj27944-8080.app.github.dev/aframe.html)
